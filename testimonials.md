*- Anja Berndt*

> Improving fitness and flexibility in a friendly and fun environment is the
> ethos of Sam’s Pilates classes. She tailors the exercise levels to suit the

> her Pilates class!

*- Yasmin Wahid*

> I came to Sam for yoga having suffered with pelvis problems. I was nervous

> straight away. She’s great at the moves, great connecting to people, but very
> modest. She doesn't take herself too seriously, enabling everyone to relax and
> enjoy the class. She’s very hands on, ensuring you’re getting the positions
> right and getting the best out of them. I think Sam should name her own style
> of yoga because what she offers is far more fun than normal yoga.

> new people to the class and offers different levels of exercise. There is a

> always keep up or do some of the exercises and never pushes me.
>
> At the moment my husband is the only man in the class, but doesn't feel out of
> place as everyone is friendly, and he really enjoys some of the female banter!
>
> If you are looking for boot camp then this isn't for you, in fact it is the

> Just great!

*- Sue Grainger*

> I started going to Sam’s classes whilst waiting to have an operation on my knee
> (torn meniscus). After just a few months on visiting my consultant, he told me
> I no longer needed an operation and said whatever I was doing was helping it to
> heal, on it's own! Needless to say, I was absolutely delighted, but obviously
> knew myself that "things had improved" a lot. So, thank you Sam, I just wish I
> had come to you earlier!

*- Judy Bale*

> Sam was recommended to me because I do a lot of cycling and have a desk job so
> I constantly had tight hamstrings, hips and lower back. Without meaning to be
> stereotypical, blokes often do lots of weight training and aerobic exercise but
> don't do focus on core stretch and flexibility. Pilates has helped alleviate
> the problems I was experiencing and comfort on longer rides is now much better.
> Sam is always very helpful and willing to answer any questions people have,
> showing a good understanding in the process.

*- Tom Jackson*

> Sam plans her Pilates classes to ensure good health and mobility both are achieved

*- Gill Pirie*

> I attend Sam's Pilates class and absolutely love it. I have seen great benefits and

> saw any improvement. She comes very highly recommended

> Sam is an inspirational teacher. I have attended both her yoga and Pilates classes.
> Sam makes her class fun and inclusive of all abilities. Giving demonstrations of all

> Sam makes her classes a joy to be in. My stamina and flexibility has improved and i
> always feel uplifted after one of Sam's classes

*- Julie Bebbington*

> Sam is the best! Her classes are so relaxed she makes everyone welcome. I just love

*- Liz Pasca*

> I love Sam's yoga class – she is always positive, never critical, and takes the time to

> right! Sam also is good at giving different options depending on ability/injuries so in a
> mixed ability class everyone can push themselves as far (or not!) as they want to.

*- Catherine McCulloch-Down*

> Sam is a truly wonderful and inspirational teacher. Her classes are fun, Varied and
> friendly. Sam's knowledge of exercise routines and what would suit individual
> participants in her class is outstanding. Sam breaks down the exercise into different
> levels and participants choose the level that is suitable for them, with Sam giving each
> participant individual attention to get the best out of the class. I have attended Sam's
> classes with some health issues and have been grateful that she has found me
> alternative ways to do the exercise, so that I will still benefit from it. Her down-to-earth,
> say-it-as-it-is delivery is unique. I would highly recommend her classes.

> pushed him to his limits which he thoroughly enjoyed! His style and confidence

> money like some teachers do! Highly recommend Sam!

*- Rachel Coleman*

> Sam is a motivational instructor who through a selective and focused training

> Very professional sports based massage. It works for stiff or tight muscles and

*- Douglas Bartley on Samantha's Body Conditioning class*

> Sam has been helping me with my fitness for over a year now. I am a 57 year old
> woman, and I have not done any sports or fitness activity since I was 16. I had
> never set foot inside a gym. Due to a problem with my vision I was becoming less
> and less active and moving more slowly. I was beginning to feel very lethargic.
> I told Sam how I was feeling and she put me at ease straight away. We discussed
> my options and she came up with a programme. Once we started I did not feel
> under any pressure to "perform", and I did not feel that she was judging what I
> could or couldn't do. She has let me take things at my own pace. I don't regret
> one moment that I have spent exercising. I feel a lot more toned and am
> definitely feeling the benefit of my sessions with Sam. I have no hesitation in
> recommending Sam as a guide to getting and keeping fit.
