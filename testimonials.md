> I told Sam how I was feeling and she put me at ease straight away. We discussed
> my options and she came up with a programme. Once we started I did not feel
> under any pressure to "perform", and I did not feel that she was judging what I
> could or couldn't do. She has let me take things at my own pace. I don't regret
> one moment that I have spent excercising. I feel a lot more toned and am
> definitely feeling the benefit of my sessions with Sam. I have no hesitation in
> recommending Sam as a guide to getting and keeping fit.
