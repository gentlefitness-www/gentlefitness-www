## Programme writing
My programme writing service consists of exercises written for you to complete
in your own time, whether this be to use in the gym, home or away with work.
The programme can be using any equipment you have or can be yoga, pilates, body
weight or water based exercises. Some people have also asked for their
programme to be for running to complete a 5K, 10K, half marathon or marathon.

Ideally your exercise programmes should be updated regularly (between 1-3
months) to ensure you are progressing towards your goals.

**£7** per programme (this does not include being shown the exercises, some
decide to pair this with a one off PT session where the programme is taught)

## Massage
**Massage with Gentle Fitness** aims to promote a feeling of good health and
wellbeing while being affordable. Massage involves manipulation of the body's
soft tissue to relieve muscle tension, back pain, headaches, aches and pains.
Massage also increases mobility and flexibility, increases relaxation and
improves the circulation.

Prior to your massage you will receive a confidential consultation that allows
Samantha to discover how to best meet your needs and will cover injuries and
medical conditions to ensure she is aware of any contra-indications (physical
conditions that would prohibit or limit a massage). Any client with certain
conditions such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, epilepsy, diabetes or trapped
nerves will need to check with a doctor before receiving a massage.

### Massage Treatments:
- Full body massage
- Back, neck and shoulder massage
- Specific area massage (i.e. legs)

Gentle Fitness ltd offers a mobile massage service which means we can meet you
at your place of work or in the comfort of your own home, equipped with a
professional massage table and everything that is required to provide your
treatment of choice. All that you need provide is the floor space of an average
wallpapering table.

Should you wish to pay for an individual session your payment must be received
prior to the treatment, however we do offer blocks of sessions at a discounted
price.

If you need to cancel your massage we require a minimum of 48 hours notice will
be needed or you will still be charged for your massage

## Swimming lessons
*Confidence in the water at any age!*

From water confidence to lessons in advanced swim technique you are sure to
receive a session to suit your needs.

Whether your first lesson covers holding hands walking through the water to get
used to it, learning breathing and getting your face wet or mastering butterfly
stroke, all levels of ability can be catered for.

Samantha currently offers lessons to clients ranging from 3 years old to mid
80's. Swimming lessons are one on one and can be held in a pool local to you.
Samantha predominantly gives lessons within the South Gloucestershire Leisure
Centres. If you’re unsure of the best location for you, get in touch.

**£20** per session (this does not include you own pool entry)

## Hydro therapy
Hydro therapy consists of exercises taught in shallow water so is suitable for
both swimmers and non-swimmers alike. Hydro therapy can help with joint pain and
in rehabilitation after surgery, for example following hip and knee
replacements. Due to the water helping to make you buoyant and lighter this very
light form of exercise minimises impact to your body.

Floatation devices and other water equipment used such as webbed gloves, floats,
noodles and resistance bands can also be used.

**£20** per session (this does not include you own pool entry)

## Personal Training
Personal training is offered in your own home or place of your choice. Samantha
specialises in special populations. This means things that need special
attention such as ante-natal, post-natal, mental health, high blood pressure,
injuries, aliments, cancer rehabilitation etc.

You may only want one session with a programme written up for you to follow
within your own time or you may want a regular session.
